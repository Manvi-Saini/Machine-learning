# Machine-learning

Diabetes Prediction Project
Developed a machine learning-based application to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals.

Utilized the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical information such as:

1. Glucose level
2. Blood pressure
3. Insulin level
4. Body Mass Index (BMI)
5. Number of pregnancies
6. Diabetes pedigree function
7. Age

Implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification due to its effectiveness in binary and high-dimensional classification tasks.

Preprocessed the data by:

1. Replacing zero values in critical health indicators with the mean of their respective columns.
2. Standardizing the dataset using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scale across all features.
3. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
4. Evaluated the model using accuracy as the primary metric.
5. Demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in healthcare to support early detection of diabetes and assist in timely medical interventions.
